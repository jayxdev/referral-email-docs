# üîí HIPAA & Privacy Act Compliance

## Executive Summary

This referral automation system is fully aligned with:

* **HIPAA (USA)**
* **Australian Privacy Act 1998 (APPs)**

Key safeguards ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive health information. No personally identifiable information (PII/PHI) is stored persistently.

## üîê Key Safeguards

| Control Area            | Implementation Detail                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Encryption (in transit) | TLS/HTTPS across all APIs and AWS services                  |
| Encryption (at rest)    | AES-256 in Amazon S3 and Secrets Manager                    |
| Secure Credentials      | AWS Secrets Manager + least privilege IAM roles             |
| Logging & Auditing      | Amazon CloudWatch + AWS CloudTrail integration              |
| Data Minimization       | Only referral-relevant data extracted via Textract/LLM      |
| Data Residency          | All data processed and stored in ap-southeast-2 (Australia) |
| Retention Policy        | No PHI is retained post-delivery; transient processing only |
| Monitoring & Alerts     | Lambda + CloudWatch logs + breach alarms                    |

## ‚úÖ HIPAA-Eligible AWS Services

| AWS Service         | HIPAA Eligible | Notes                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS Textract        | ‚úÖ              | Must be covered by BAA, no data retained post-OCR   |
| AWS Bedrock (Haiku) | ‚úÖ              | Does not store inputs; no model fine-tuning on data |
| AWS Secrets Manager | ‚úÖ              | Stores credentials encrypted with AES-256           |
| AWS Lambda          | ‚úÖ              | Ephemeral execution, logs stream to CloudWatch      |
| Amazon S3           | ‚úÖ              | Encrypted + versioning + bucket policy enforced     |

## üîÅ Breach Monitoring & Incident Response

- CloudWatch monitors all Lambda and Textract activity.
- Alarms configured for unusual behavior or data access anomalies.
- Defined incident response procedures (e.g., disable IAM user, revoke secrets, notify team).
